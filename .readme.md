This is a simple small coil winder using 3D printed (MLSA) hardware , software in Python running on a Raspberry Pi or PC.

Pulse train generation, for the two stepper motors, is handled by a couple of PIC12F1572s. Another PIC12F1572 is used to count revolutions of the spindle to allow manual starting of the winding without losing count of the turns.
